# pancreatic-cancer-prediction

This project focuses on the early detection of pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest cancers due to its late diagnosis and subtle symptoms. Using machine learning models trained on clinical and biochemical data, the system predicts the likelihood of pancreatic cancer in patients. The goal is to support early screening and diagnosis using non-invasive patient data, improving chances for timely treatment and survival.

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Model

We trained and evaluated several ML classifiers to identify the most effective model for this classification task.
Techniques used include:
Data preprocessing & feature selection
Model training & validation
Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
